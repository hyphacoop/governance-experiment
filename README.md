This repository hosts Hypha's collaborative governance experiment, a project exploring decentralized decision-making, participatory processes, and visual storytelling. The experiment combines historical insights, interactive tools, and decentralized voting mechanisms to foster better governance and collective lore creation.

The project comprises two main components:
- [**Dashboard**](./dashboard): A frontend interface for collaborative decision-making, visualizing proposals, and vote results.
- [**Timeline**](./timeline): A visual representation of key moments in Hypha's history, co-created through participatory processes.

## Project Description

This governance experiment aims to:
1. **Document and Visualize History:** Create a co-op timeline by identifying and voting on key events.
2. **Test Governance Tools:** Explore decentralized and participatory decision-making processes using various platforms.
3. **Build Co-op Lore:** Enhance the cooperative’s narrative by collaboratively curating and celebrating its milestones.

Through the experiment, we:
- Collect and analyze historical data from meeting notes, proposals, and decisions.
- Use multiple voting platforms to deliberate and decide what becomes part of the timeline.
- Leverage decentralized technologies, such as Earthstar, for secure, anonymous voting.

## Process

1. **Data Collection:** Extract insights from meeting notes and cooperative history.
2. **Voting and Deliberation:** Use a combination of voting tools, including ADoodle, Onvote.app, and a custom-built Earthstar-based voting interface, to gather participants' approval.
3. **Visualization:** Represent selected events visually through the [timeline](./timeline).
4. **Feedback and Iteration:** Gather member feedback to refine the tools and processes.
5. **Lore Creation:** Publish a finalized timeline and decisions as part of Hypha’s lore.

## Voting Platforms

### Ready-to-Use Voting Tools
We used ADoodle and Onvote.app to test different voting platforms.

### Constellate: Our Custom-Built Earthstar-Based Voting Interface
For sensitive or anonymous votes, we developed [Constellate](https://github.com/tripledoublev/voting-interface), an Earthstar-based voting tool. This platform ensures confidentiality while enabling accurate vote tallying.

### GitHub Project Boards
We used GitHub issues and project boards for tracking decisions, proposals, and feedback during the experiment.

## Tools Used

- **[Dashboard](./dashboard):** Visualizes decision logs, vote results, and other governance data.
- **[Timeline](./timeline):** Showcases selected co-op milestones.
- **Earthstar:** A decentralized storage platform used for vote management and results.
- **Matrix:** Our chat space for discussions.
- **Google Sheets:** Provides an accessible interface for decision logs.
- **GitHub:** Facilitates issue tracking and repository management.
