This repository hosts Hypha's collaborative governance experiment, a project exploring decentralized decision-making, participatory processes, and visual storytelling. The experiment combines historical insights, interactive tools, and decentralized voting mechanisms to foster better governance and collective lore creation.

The project comprises two main components:
- [**Dashboard**](./dashboard): A frontend interface for collaborative decision-making, visualizing proposals, and vote results.
- [**Timeline**](./timeline): A visual representation of key moments in Hypha's history, co-created through participatory processes.

### Earthstar-based Voting Tool

For more sensitive votes, we can use the Earthstar-based voting tool I built, which allows for anonymous voting. This tool is ideal for scenarios where voter privacy is essential, ensuring that votes remain confidential while still allowing for accurate and fair decision-making.

### On-chain

For this initial experiment, I suggest 2 options. Either we mint the tokens on testnet or on Polygon. Testnet will be free and might reduce some financial pressure. Alternatively, if we choose to go with Polygon, we can consider the option of minting these tokens as collectibles for the broader public. Orb seems like an interesting option where these items could exist for the public to collect (Orb being a web3 social platform part of the Lens protocol).

In the end, these options are not mutually exclusive. We could run the governance experiment on testnet and also mint them as collectible NFTs on another chain.

In summary, these NFTs could exist both on Ethereum testnet or on a cheap EVM chain such as Polygon. I decided to keep votes and other decisions off-chain for this early phase. Instead of having the entire process live on the blockchain, I opted to only bring its final output on-chain. This means that the prior steps are designed as a mechanism for deciding what we want to bring on-chain.

I imagine this will simplify the process for everyone and will allow us to focus on the decision-making process itself instead of technical details such as tokens, chains, and wallet interactions.

### Conclusion

### Conclusion

Through this process, we aim to learn how to better deliberate, make proposals, and make decisions. The result will be an enhanced decision-making process and also, some content and images about the cooperative's history â€” essentially, creating the co-op lore. This low-stakes exercise will help us test out generative decision processes and provide ideas on how to better work together. This process will also lead to what we reveal and to what extent. Some of these insights might be important but too sensitive to be shared in public. In such cases, we could decide to encrypt or hash the data to conceal or obfuscate certain details. This experiment also offers an opportunity to preserve and celebrate our cooperative's history through the minting of digital artifacts.

By simplifying the process and not using DAO tooling, we can focus more on the decision-making aspect itself, ensuring the process is accessible and straightforward for all participants. This technical detail could always be revised and integrated if there is an interest to bring more of the decision process on-chain.
