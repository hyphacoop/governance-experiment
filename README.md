# governance-experiment

This repository hosts the collaborative governance experiment project for Hypha. Our goal is to create a visual timeline of the co-opâ€™s history through a collaborative process using DAO tooling. This experiment aims to:

    - Draw on our recorded history to select and vote on key events to include in the timeline.
    - Utilize iconography, mycorrhizal-inspired images, and similar visual inspirations to create a visual representation of this timeline.
    - Test the viability of DAO tools in a small-scale setting and assess their potential for use in slightly larger organizations (50-100 people).
    - Develop and document a series of desirable criteria for the tool (e.g., fun to use, transparent, fast) and gather feedback from colleagues on the process.
    - Contribute to the lore creation of our co-op by telling the story of what and why we are.

Additionally, we would like to propose the creation of a *proof-of-governance* process for some of our 2024 AGM decisions.
