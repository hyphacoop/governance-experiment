L-systems, or Lindenmayer systems, are a mathematical formalism proposed by the biologist Aristid Lindenmayer in 1968. They were initially developed to model the growth processes of plant development and other organisms, but they have since found applications in computer graphics, particularly for generating fractals and simulating organic forms such as plants and trees.
