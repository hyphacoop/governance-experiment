At the 2019? (held late 2018) retreat, a long list of values was recorded under the title [Finding Value Alignment](https://meetings.hypha.coop/2018-12-04-retreat-day-01.html#finding-value-alignment).

At the 2021 retreat, participants aligned on the following short-list of [values](https://handbook.hypha.coop/Hypha-Worker-Co-operative/vision.html#values):

> Curiosity
> Intersectionality
> Honesty
> Self-Agency
> Solidarity



At our upcoming retreat, it could be interesting to reiterate the importance of these values. See how current members align with these and potentially reassess this short-list.


Here is the list of values from 2018:

> Intersectionality: recognize differences and work across those differences
> Inclusivity
> Mutual Aid
> Justice (Environmental)
> Anti-facism
> [anti-racism, anti-oppression]
> Practicing what you preach
> Care for others
> Forgiveness and having paths back in
> [self-agency, self-determination]
> capacity to share
> Courage
> Solidarity
> multi-faceted knowledge
> Curiosity, Diverse perspectives
> Sustainability
> Resilience
> "structured chaos": recognizing changing ecosystem, less predictability, learn to embrace/find ways to progress through that
> Interdependent Abundance (Collective self-agency)
> Community
> Integrity
> Transparency
> Financial security: so we can focus on the work and not worry about the financials
> Radical reflection
> Grace
> Honesty
